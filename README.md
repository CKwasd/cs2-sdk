## What's this?
Counter-Strike 2 SDK written in C++ to aid your development. This SDK has been written as simplified as possible and kept as close as possible to Source 2 code supporting both DirectX11 and Vulkan graphical APIs. I'll keep the project updated if I have time, project's features can be seen in the picture below.
